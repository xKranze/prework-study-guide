# Prework Study Guide Webpage.

## Introduction

- Ive always like to learn new things and always wanted to learn how to code.  Ive had friends to finally push me to finally take the step in taking this class.  I want to say im tech savy but never knew the behind the things of how things are created/coded.  I am ecstatic to finally be able to learn the basics.
- I built this project as a starting point to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and to learn how they work with each other.
- Ive learned that:
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure basically the frame.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), lets you add your style to the content.
JavaScript (JS), handles logic and functions which makes interactions possible.
- Ive also learn some of the basics to using GitBash, VS Code and Github.
